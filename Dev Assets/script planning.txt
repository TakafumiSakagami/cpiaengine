Work.
That's all life is.
Work.

How long has it been since I did anything else?
I can hardly remember.

There's been no room for distractions.
Time moves too fast. Well, when it isn't moving too slow.
A friend from school is getting married soon, apparently.
Where did he get the time?

I've been in this city my whole working life, and yet...
It's all unfamiliar to me.

Where would I get the time to explore it?
When could I ever meet someone?
It's all... unfamiliar to me.

Work.
That's all life is.
The store next to my apartment is all I need to know.

Thud.
I step out onto the street, walking weary.

If I'd remembered that my fridge was empty sooner, I could've been in bed by now.

"Oh man..."
The other side of the road looks hazy. My eyes fail to focus.
Am I getting short-sighted now? I don't know the first thing about glasses...
That sounds like more work.

"Where..."
I turn my head, left then right.
"Where did I live...?"
Obviously I know. I have to know.
But... where am I?

Behind me, the doors of a shop I just exited open wide.
Pin-pon!
Another person leaves.

This... is the store I usually go to, isn't it?
They all look the same to me.
These shops.
This city.
What am I even doing here?

Into an alleyway I step.
There was no such alleyway at the store near my place.
But weirdly, it's the only place that feels familiar to me.
I can feel it in my heart.
"Home is this way!", it says.
My head drops, before I catch myself drifting off.
Whatever you say.
My beating heart is all that keeps me going.
I'd be a fool not to follow it.
Soon, I'll be...
Home.

They say that, in this city...
The ancient one is waiting.
How many years has she lived?

??? "Aaah, I wanted them to meet again!"
What is that noise?
??? "A long story deserves a happier ending!"
An unfamiliar voice...

Where am I?

I awake from a sleep I'd been unaware of, to a sight I'd never expected.
A girl, sat before a screen, crying her eyes out.
A girl... That's what she is, right?
What's with the ears?

??? "Uwa!"
Upon hearing me wake, the girl's attention is naturally drawn towards me.
She begins wiping away her tears in a panic.
??? "I always forget about-!"
??? "I'm such an idiot!"
As if to snap herself out of whatever sadness she was feeling, she bumps her knuckles against her forehead.
