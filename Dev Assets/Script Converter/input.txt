You "Hey, isn't this TV... Weird?"
Her "How do you mean?"
You "Well, look at it..."
Her "Mhm."
You "You don't think it's strange?"
Her "Not really. It's a normal TV."
You "That's not right, is it? TVs aren't that thin..."
You "And they don't come with little stands like that."
Her "But it's a box with a screen."
You "Huh, there aren't even any dials. It really is strange."
You "Where'd you find it?"
Her "Huh? Where'd I find it?"
You "That's what I asked."
Her "Uuuuh..."
Her "I can't remember!"
You "There's that terrible memory again."
Her "Ehehe~ It's a forever problem."
You "You should really try and fix that. Memory loss isn't a normal thing."
Her "Uuuu, that's fine. I'm not normal anyway!"
You "Anyway, it's a color television too. Not many places around here sell those kinds."
Her "Yeah?"
You "We'd have to go into the city center for all the new fancy stuff."
You "Maybe I'll ask around next time I head down there."
Her "Will you get me a present on the way?"
You "Sure, just put the money for it in our account."
Her "Eeeh, stingy!"

Her "Hmm? You want to talk?"

Her "Oh, by the way..."
You "Yeah?"
Her "We got some mail earlier."
You "Oh? Important mail?"
Her "Maybe~ The sender had your surname."
You "Where is it? I'll check it out."
Her "On the table~"
You "Thanks."
"I walk over to the table and look through a small pile of papers."
"Flicking through them all, I happen upon a signed envelope."
"The name scribed atop the seal is an all too familiar one."
"\"Ida\"... My mother."
"I open it up and skim through the letter."
"It's the typical update letter. Stuff about people in the village and what they're up to."
"Some words asking about city life. A bit about the news..."
"Nothing particularly interesting, but there's a tinge of nostalgia embedded within this familiar handwriting."
Her "So? How is it?"
You "Ah... It's just an update letter. She sends these sometimes."
Her "I see~"
"I place the letter aside. I can store it somewhere later."
Her "Do you miss her?"
You "Kinda... But not really."
Her "Then... Does she miss you?"
You "Ahaha, probably. But she's always been good at staying too busy to think."
Her "How so?"
You "She always volunteers for community activities, and she spends a lot of time getting caught up in the fictional worlds of books."
Her "Community activities... It sounds nice, village life."
You "It'd suit you~"
Her "What kinds of books does she read?"
You "Aah, typical mom stuff. She likes romance stories mostly. And books with inspiring female leads..."
You "When she was younger she really liked this one book..."
You "My gran... Her mom... She used to read it to her when she was a child."
You "And so when I was born, she really wanted to name me after it."
You "Anne if I was female. Edward if I were male."
You "Of course my dad wasn't fond of either."
Her "Ehehe, the classic name discussions. That must be a hard thing to decide on."
Her "Oh, if you had a kid, what would you name it?"
You "I really can't imagine having a kid..."
Her "Eeh, come on! What if we woke up tomorrow and there was a baby between us?"
You "I'd question reality..."
Her "And then give the baby a name! So what would you name it?"
You "Uuuuum... I've never really thought about this kind of thing before."
Her "Never?"
You "Never."
Her "Uuu, fine. Then I'll tell you mine!"
"She gets close and whispers a name into my ear..."
Her "Ehehe~ What do you think?"
You "...Rejected."
Her "EEEEH!? WHY?"
You "We're not naming them that!"
Her "Ehehe, now we're like parents~"
You "Ahaha~"
You "So, what's your family like? Any interesting stories?"
Her "Eh? Me?"
You "Yeah. Come on, spill the beans~"
Her "I prefer my beans unspilt!"
You "Mom? Dad? Anything?"
Her "Hmm... Then..."
Her "I had like... An older sister."
You "Oooh, you did?"
Her "Mhm! She's why I'm here today. She made me who I am."
You "And your parents didn't?"
Her "Pffft! Shush you!"
You "What was she like?"
Her "Hmm... Mature."
You "Classic older sister material."
Her "No no, not that kind of mature. Like a grumpy old lady."
You "Seriously?"
Her "She had charisma, and she was funny, but she always had bags under her eyes."
Her "And she always looked... Very very tired."
Her "Ah, but she was inspiring!"
You "What did she do? Did she have a stressful job or something?"
Her "Hmm... She traveled."
You "What kind of job is that...?"
Her "She went from place to place, meeting new people and learning new things."
Her "She taught me a lot about the world."
Her "It's like... Before then I didn't realize how big it was. There were more people and places out there than I could imagine."
You "That's right, you've always been a city girl."
Her "Mhm, so the stories that she would tell me... They let me imagine a world beyond my own."
Her "I realized that my existence was just a small part of something more. That there was something for me to find..."
You "She sounds nice."
Her "Yeah... She was."
You "So, role reversal! Do you miss her?"
Her "Question thief!"
You "Ahaha~"
Her "I do, sometimes... But..."
You "But?"
Her "You're here."
Her "When I look at you, I feel a warmth. Something I can't describe."
Her "It fills me up entirely. Every dream and every desire... That's what I see when I look at you."
Her "How could I ever miss anyone when everything I need is right here?"
You "...!"
Her "Ehehe, you're blushing."
You "No I'm not!"
Her "Yes you aaare!"
You "You've already stolen my heart! You don't need to keep doing it!"
Her "I've got to make sure I got everything~"
You "You did! There's nothing left!"
Her "Reeeaaally?"
You "It's true."
Her "Prove it."
You "How?"
Her "...Tell me you love me."
You "I do that all the time! I loooove you!"
Her "Ehehe~ Then... Kiss me."
You "Okay maybe we don't do that all the time... But umm..."
Her "Pfft, so shy! Come come."
You "Aaah fine! But don't try to suffocate me this time!"
Her "I never try to do that! ...Not intentionally."
You "Suuuure you don't."
Her "Shhh, kissy time."
You "You- MMM!"
Her "Mwah!"
You "Haah! You surprised me!"
Her "Ehehe~"
You "Anyway! There's your proof!"
Her "But... I initiated it. You need to initiate!"
You "Eh? Then..."
Her "We've already kissed. The next task is harder!"
You "Eeeh? When did this become such a large quest?"
Her "Ask me on a date!"
You "Oh, easy! Let's go out together. Wanna see a movie?"
Her "...Too casual."
You "Eeeh, but that's how I always do it!"
Her "How about... You ask me to marry you?"
You "...!"
Her "You're blushing again!"
You "No I'm nooot!"
Her "Ehehe, I was joking though~"
You "Haah! Don't shock me like that."
Her "But I wouldn't say no~"
You "...!"
Her "Pffft, so shhyyyy!"
"I spent the rest of my morning dizzy from blushing so much."

Her "Oh, did you hear about Gaulle? Another veto apparently."

Her "Do you still have that red dress? You looked sooo good in it."

Her "The neighbours have this big plantie on the balcony that hasn't been trimmed for months!"

Her "Ugh, who decided cooking broadcasts should be a thing? The eating sounds drive me crazy!"

You "So this is the laptop?"
Her "Mhm."
You "What does it even do?"
Her "All kinds of things."
You "Like...?"
Her "Uuumm... You can write stuff on it. Listen to music..."
Her "Oh, you can look at pictures!"
Her "You could even edit them!"
You "Eeeh? In a little box like that?"
Her "Mhm."
You "That's pretty amazing..."
Her "It's not really that amazing though."
You "But wasn't it made by people?"
You "How do people even figure out how to make this stuff?"
Her "Hmm... Aliens?"
You "Haha, but really."
Her "Well, just think. Not long ago we didn't have TVs at all..."
Her "We didn't have cameras either."
You "True..."
Her "We didn't even know how to copy documents automatically."
Her "Then poof, it all appears."
You "But it's a series of steps."
You "I imagine once you've figured out how to take a photo, making a TV isn't too crazy."
You "And then turning a TV into... Whatever this laptop thing is..."
You "Same with cars, right? They're this big unmoving box, and there's a window that shows an unmoving person hovering inside."
You "And then four little circles at the bottom are the only elements that move."
You "It's like seeing a box float along the ground..."
You "But when you look at all the parts, it makes sense."
Her "Darling... You think about things in weird ways."
You "EH? But it's true! Next time you see a car, look at it like that."
Her "But even with all that said..."
Her "This laptop proves that there's a lot more potential beyond modern technology."
You "So until we fulfill all of that potential you won't call anything amazing?"
Her "There's a lot more to discover."
You "But it comes off the back of our previous discoveries."
You "Maybe the amazing part is the entire process."
Her "Oh! You can process files too."
You "Eh? What does that even mean!?"

Her "Oooh, this Mr. Weirdlove movie sounds interesting. Can we go see it?"
You "Weirdlove? Sounds weird, love."
Her "Awwwn, you called me love!"
You "It was for the joke!"
Her "Say it again!"
You "Eh? No! You're making it embarrassing!"
Her "Eeeeh? There's nothing to be embarrassed about~"
Her "Look look. It's just us."
Her "There's no one else here~"
You "S- So!?"
Her "Daaaaaarling~!"
You "Uuu, I'll start a snuggle war if you keep pushing it."
Her "Yay~ Let's do it!"

Her "Hey darling, do you like it?"
You "Hmm?"
Her "The house! It looks so good now that it's furnished, right?"
You "Yeah, it's great."
"It was a big empty space when we got here, but now it looks small and homely. A big change."
"Though some of the furniture looks strange. I'll have to ask her about that TV..."
Her "Hey darling..."
You "Hmm?"
Her "You need me, right?"
You "Huh, need you?"
Her "To live."
You "Of course. What makes you ask that?"
Her "I just wanted to make sure."
You "Hmm, well... I can understand that."
You "Sometimes I feel the same. Like..."
You "Why did you pick me? Am I good enough?"
You "Things like that..."
Her "Then we both feel the same way."
You "Yeah, it's strange... But I guess that's love."
Her "Ehehe, lovey dovey~"
You "Ah, but why did you pick me?"
Her "Eeeeh... I've told you already."
You "You have?"
Her "All the time! We're the same, right?"
You "Heh? We're totally different!"
Her "But look at you..."
Her "Long dark hair that hates uniformity..."
Her "Lips that curve quicker to disgust and anger than to anything else..."
Her "Eyes that look lost. Tired. Lonely."
Her "And then... Deep down I see a sparkle."
You "A sparkle? What does that mean?"
Her "A small little sparkle that keeps you alive in this world."
You "Like hope?"
Her "Yeah, maybe. I want to be that sparkle for you, and I want you to be that sparkle for me."
Her "Shining together... Just like this."
You "So we can continue to live?"
Her "So we can continue to live."
You "Then... I'll try to shine as bright as I can."
Her "Ehehe, the hair might get in the way though."
You "Pfft, maybe!"
Her "Hey, darling..."
You "Hmm?"
Her "Thanks for living with me."
You "Yeah, you too. Thank you."
Her "Let's stay like this..."
You "Forever?"
Her "Ehehe~"

"Haaah... What time is it?"
"When did I fall asleep...?"
"I think it was only for a moment."
"I can feel the exhaustion clamping down on my head."
"Right... I should go to bed."
Her "Darling? Are you okay?"
You "Huh? What do you mean?"
Her "You look tired..."
You "Well... It is late."
Her "Come, come. You can rest in my arms~"
You "Oh I see. You're looking for an excuse to snuggle?"
Her "Ehehe~ You figured it out."
You "Yeah..."
Her "Mmmm~ Huggy huggy."
"Even if I don't tell her that I'm tired... She knows."
"She pays more attention to me than I do to anything."
"Of course she'd know."
"..."
"I gently pet her head."
You "Thanks."
Her "Ehehe~"
"She really is... perfect..."
"I wouldn't mind..."
"Sleeping like..."
"This..."

Her "Hmm? Garden?"
"I decide to ask about gardening."
Her "I didn't think you were interested in that kind of stuff."
You "You're interested in it, right?"
You "So I want to know more about it."
Her "You do?"
You "Yeah."
Her "Ehehe~ I'll be the teacher then."
"We head out onto the balcony."
Her "Unfortunately there's not much room out here, but there's enough space for a few planties."
You "It looks sunny out here at least."
Her "Aah, but that'll burn a lot of plants..."
You "Eeh, they can burn? That seems kinda cruel."
Her "Think of it like eating chilli."
You "Right. Giant UV deathray chilli."
Her "Mhm, exactly."
Her "Look look, this is baby me."
"She points to a small potted plant covered in red and pink flowers."
Her "Geranium! Doesn't it look like me?"
You "Oooh, you're right. It looks like your hair!"
You "Ah but the redder ones look like Euon."
Her "Euon?"
You "Uuuh, an old friend. She's all red and green."
Her "Like Euonymus?"
You "Yeah, I think that was her full name."
You "Eh wait, how'd you know?"
Her "Oh... I meant the type of plant. Euonymus."
You "There's a Euon plant too!?"
Her "Mhm. Plenty."
You "Do I get a plant then...?"
Her "Hmmm... Maybe?"
You "Eeeeh?"
Her "How about this... If you find some seeds, we'll plant them here."
Her "Then whatever grows from them will be your plant!"
You "Sounds fun. I'll keep an eye out then... Maybe."
Her "You better be quick~ It might get away from you."
You "Pffft, the seeds will roll in fear when they hear me come."
Her "Oh no! The big scary seedgrabber!"
You "Ahaha, but I'll bring them to a nice home. To you."
Her "I'll take care of them~ Little baby planties."
"We watered the plants."

Her "Oh, did you get the seeds?"
Her "Oooh, let's see~ What did you get?"
You "Uuuumm... I'm not sure."
Her "Then... That might be a problem."
You "Can't we just grow them and see?"
Her "We'll have to."
Her "I'll just have to take special care of it~"
You "Then it really will be like me."
Her "Ehehe~ Hopefully a mini you grows."
You "It better not steal any of my portions of love."
Her "You don't get a portion! You get it all!"
"We watered the plants."

Her "Oh, did you get the seeds?"
Her "No? You should hurry!"
You "There's no rush. Isn't gardening all about patience?"
Her "True... But..."
You "But?"
Her "The sun won't shine on us forever you know?"
You "Eeeh? What does that mean?"
You "The sun will always be here. At least as long as we're here."
Her "You think?"
You "It won't just go out."
Her "It might pop!"
You "What is it, a bubble!?"
Her "A big burny bubble."
You "Anyway, shall we water the plants?"
Her "Oh, sure~"
"We watered the plants."

Her "Gardening again? You're really getting into it~"

Her "Hmm? Time to garden?"
Her "Ehehe~"
"We watered the plants."

"I go on the search for some ducks."
"The park certainly isn't the best place to find them, but they shouldn't be rare."

"I go on the search for a river."
"Here in the park there are many little streams. That water must come from somewhere."
"So... Maybe there's a river nearby?"

"I go on the search for a shop."
"For some reason I decided to go to the park..."
"But aside from a museum and a play area for kids, there's nothing in here."

"I go on the search for some flowers."
"This park is the biggest area dedicated to nature for miles."
"I'm certain there are many beautiful flowers to choose from here."

"Oh! While I'm here..."
"I should get those seeds we talked about."
"Aha, found some seeds! Hope they're good."

"I go on the search for some boats."
"I remember hearing they have an old boat in the museum here, so I should check it out."

"I go on the search for a church."
"If I cut through the park, on the far side should be an old church."
"It's a bit out of the way, but it's the grandest church around."

"I go on the search for a museum."
"The only museum in the city is right here, in this park."
"It's an interesting place, but I don't have all day."
"I'll just take that photo."

"I go on the search for some bees."
"It's a weird request, but I figure I can do this right."
"Where there are flowers there are bees."

"I go on the search for a supermarket."
"For some reason I decided to go to the park..."
"But aside from a museum and a play area for kids, there's nothing in here."

"I go on the search for some seagulls."
"When I heard the request was for an animal, I came here immediately..."
"But there are no seagulls here. Maybe we're too far from the sea?"

"I go on the search for a bridge."
"There are several small streams in this park."
"To bridge the tiny gap they made some tiny bridges."
"They're kinda cute~"

"I go on the search for a squirrel."
"When I heard the request was for an animal, I came here immediately."
"There are many trees here, and many playful squirrels running up and down them."
"It's the perfect location."

Euon "Peekaboo!"
You "Oh, Euon! Don't scare me like that!"
Euon "Whatcha doin'?"
You "Just finishing up with work. You?"
Euon "Same. Wanna walk back together?"
You "Uh... Okay, sure."
Euon "I'll stick to flying though."
You "Hang on, you work? When did you get a job?"
Euon "I don't."
You "Why did you say \"same\" then?"
Euon "Isn't that how humans converse?"
You "In the right context..."
Euon "Close enough."
You "Ahaha, maybe one day you'll have this communication thing figured out."
Euon "Hey, a fairy's strongest trait is their ability to communicate!"
You "Reeeaaally? I find that hard to believe."
Euon "You don't know about our magic?"
You "Like the fake magic you put on my camera?"
Euon "No no, we have real magic too!"
You "Nope. I don't believe you."
Euon "Rude! Don't underestimate a fairy!"
You "Didn't your parents ever teach you not to cry wolf?"
Euon "As if I'd remember what happened that many years ago!"
You "Wait, you don't remember your parents?"
Euon "I do! Kinda... But not really."
You "How short term is your memory...?"
Euon "Hey! I'm muuuuch older than you!"
You "...Right."
Euon "It's true! I'm hundreds of years old! Probably!"
You "Probably?"
Euon "It's easy to lose track!"
You "You're actually... Not a kid?"
Euon "You thought I was a child this entire time?"
You "Well... Yeah."
Euon "The fact that I haven't aged a day since we met didn't clue you in?"
You "Now that you mention it..."
Euon "Siiigh, you humans..."
You "Hey, don't put it like that. I'm not an example of all humanity."
Euon "I know. You're friendly."
You "...Is that a compliment to me or an insult to humanity?"
Euon "Yes."
You "Okay, nice answer."
Euon "You know, when I was young, this world was very different."
You "How so?"
Euon "You humans were not a new sight, but you were a far cry from conquerors of the planet."
You "You're... That old?"
Euon "Yup. Back then... Well, there used to be so many of us."
Euon "So many fairies across the world."
Euon "Some days I would sit upon a tree branch, or fly out towards the sun, and I would hear them."
Euon "Millions of lives. All of them so different."
Euon "That's our magic. The ability to connect with life."
You "So that's your ability to communicate...?"
Euon "But now the world is human. Only that."
Euon "Us fairies hardly belong here. There's no space for us anymore."
Euon "Like the birds, or the reptiles... The fish, the mammals. Even the bugs."
Euon "None of us belong here anymore."
You "I wouldn't put it like that..."
Euon "We're dying. Just take a look."
Euon "Sometimes I try. I fly out to nature and I sit upon a leaf."
Euon "I don't hear them anymore."
Euon "Instead I hear screaming."
Euon "And 8 billion Humans."
You "...I see."
Euon "That's why we all move to the cities. To depend on the abundance of humanity."
Euon "But... At least there's some kindness out there."
Euon "Like you."
Euon "So even if the planet dies, I'll be glad to have met you."
Euon "There's some solace in that."
You "Even if the planet... Dies?"
Euon "Don't worry about it. It's not that bad yet."
You "Yet?"
Euon "And there are other planets to move to. It won't be an end for humans."
You "...And the fairies?"
Euon "..."
You "Euon?"
Euon "Ah, this is my stop! Time to split."
"The fairy flies off into the trees."
You "I wonder if fairies can cry..."
"I turn my attention to the street leading home."
"The sight of a pink haired girl tending to her flowers comes to mind."
You "I wonder..."
"How would she respond to this kind of conversation?"

"I go on the search for some ducks."
"It only makes sense to look for them near the river. That's where they live."

"I go on the search for a river."
"It's not much of a search though. There's a river right here!"

"I go on the search for a shop."
"If I remember correctly, there are some small family businesses around the riverside."
"It's not the best place for shopping, but it's useful for people who live nearby."

"While searching, I notice a small furniture shop."
"A specific lamp in the window catches my attention."
You "Hmm... Maybe we could do with an extra light."
"The corner of the room where the bed sits gets very dark sometimes..."
"Yeah sure, I'll buy a lamp."

"I go on the search for some flowers."
"I remember seeing lots of trees and bushes in this area."
"But now that I'm here, I realize there aren't actually any flowers here."

"I go on the search for some boats."
"They have plenty of boats here. They're some sort of tourist attraction I think."

"I go on the search for a church."
"But here near the river, the only buildings are houses, hotels, and shops."
"There's no church here."

"I go on the search for a museum."
"But the only museum in the city is in the park."
"There's no museum out here."

"I go on the search for some bees."
"It's a weird request, so I'm not really sure where to look."
"Are there even any beehives in the city?"

"I go on the search for a supermarket."
"The riverside didn't seem like too much of a long shot."
"Though there are many shops here, there's no supermarket."

"I go on the search for some seagulls."
"Seagulls love water, I think. It's in the name at least..."
"So the riverside seems like the best spot to find them."

"I go on the search for a bridge."
"This river splits the city in two."
"And how do you get across that split?"
"A bridge!"

"I go on the search for a squirrel."
"There are some trees here, so maybe there'll be some squirrels?"
"I'm sure I'll find at least one.."

"I go on the search for some ducks."
"But out here in the busy city streets, ducks will be a rare sight."

"I go on the search for a river."
"But I've gone far in-land. Why would there be a river out here?"

"I go on the search for a shop."
"Downtown is where all the business happens. There are shops aplenty."
"Such a selection of displays, I may as well take some extra photos."

"I go on the search for some flowers."
"City streets aren't normally where you'd go to find wild flowers..."
"But the boss said nothing about wild."
"I can just go to a flower shop!"

"I go on the search for some boats."
"But I don't think I'll find any here. There's no water in this area."
"Maybe if I'm lucky, someone will have gotten shipwrecked here."
"As if!"

"I go on the search for a church."
"Amidst all these shops, there's bound to be a modern church."
"One of those new ones that doesn't really look like a church."
"It's technically still what the boss asked for."

"I go on the search for a museum."
"But the only museum in the city is in the park."
"There's no museum out here."

"I go on the search for some bees."
"It's a weird request, so I'm not really sure where to look."
"Are there even any beehives in the city?"

"I go on the search for a supermarket."
"There are multiple to choose from in this area."
"I may as well take some extra photos."

"I go on the search for some seagulls."
"There are some fish and chip shops in this area..."
"And if I know anything about seagulls, they love fish and chips."

"I go on the search for a bridge."
"But this area is one big grid of streets."
"No gaps. No water. No clearings."
"No bridge."

"I go on the search for a squirrel."
"There are lots of people here. Won't they scare away any squirrels?"
"I don't think I'll find one here."

Man "Hey kid."
"On the way back home, a rough hand grabs my shoulder."
Man "That camera. How long have you had it?"
You "Huh? Uuum... 10 years I think. Why?"
Man "You're a catcher? Here in the city?"
You "Catcher? What-"
Man "Come with me."
"The man pulls me into a shop."
"The inside is full of technology, some I've never even seen before."
Man "You the supplier?"
You "Huh?"
Man "Guess not. You're a buyer then."
"On one of the many displays I spot a familiar sight."
You "Ah, so that's where our TV came from."
Man "You bought one of those beauties? Rare model. Not cheap."
You "Not me. My girlfriend must've bought it."
Man "Yeah? She must have a keen eye for technology."
You "Ahaha, I don't know about that."
Man "Tell ya what. We got some great gifts here. Spot something she might like and I'll even wrap it for ya."
Man "Pricey stuff though. What's her favorite color?"
You "Eh? Ah, pink."
Man "Pink eh? How 'bout this laptop then?"
"The man brings up a small portable tv thing, encased in pink."
Man "Only costs a thousand."
You "Laptop? What is it?"
Man "It's a computer. Tool of convenience."
You "EH? THAT'S A COMPUTER?"
You "But... It's so small!"
Man "Impressive huh? Just a hundo and you can have it."
You "How does it work?"
Man "You just press the power button. Then it works like... A typewriter."
You "Ah, but who made it? Shouldn't they be on the news?"
Man "Nah mate, you won't see this stuff in any newspapers."
You "Why not?"
Man "'cause it don't exist yet. Like that camera o' yours."
You "...What?"
Man "You didn't even know? Haha, tell ya what. Buy the laptop and I'll tell ya."

You "Fine, I'll take it."
Man "Pass the cash and we got a deal."
"I bought the laptop."
Man "This stuff is all grabbed, y'see. Plucked from a place beyond."
You "What kind of explanation is that?"
Man "Sometimes, for the lucky folk, the future appears to 'em. Sends 'em stuff."
You "So this is all future technology?"
Man "Sure is. Pretty magical, ey?"
You "So that's it? They just appear here?"
Man "That's it."
You "Well, this laptop thing better be worth the money, 'cause the explanation wasn't."
Man "Haha, nice doin' business with ya."

You "I don't really want to spend that kind of money. Sorry."
Man "Nah, makes sense. Not much use for a laptop in this day and age."
"I decided not to buy the laptop."
